# sprite-finder

Live Demo: https://jerryc96.github.io/sprite-finder/

A javascript tool for quickly generating the locations of sprites on a spritesheet image file. Uses Bootstrap for look and feel.

To run: Download the repository and open index.html in your browser.

Upload the spritesheet and the program will output a map of all of the sprites found in the sprite sheet by their x, y, width and height values, where the x and y values represent the top left corner of the sprite relative to its position on the sprite sheet.

For fun, the sprite-finder also displays the spritesheet with all of the sprites inverted!
